## Contrib

### Art

#### Blender

Origin point of the car body on the wheel level and centered
Empty for each wheel named Wheel#R or Wheel#L
Shade smooth
Auto Smooth around 20Â°
Modeling steps :
- Start by making a box of the size of the car
- Align the blueprints to the box (Front of the car is -Y)
- Model with symetry modifier applied on X axis `body`
- Define texture seam `cmd+E`
- Create a texture of size `256x256` for a basic car size
- Unwrap the texture `U` and use the plugin `Texel Density Checker by mrven` to scale the uv map (Texture size `256` TD `0.33` set my td)
- Model the wheel with a cylinder with a
- Place the wheels empty on each side name them depending on the side `wheelR1` `wheelL2` (could do it with empty rotation but harder to see)
- Using gltf exporter -> Export the body (selection only) with applied modifier
- Export the wheel


#### Pixel scale

1m50 -> 50 pixels

### Texture

First 5 pixels define the colors palette than can be altered to change the car color
1 : base
2 : darker
3 : lighter
4 : darker+
5 : lighter+

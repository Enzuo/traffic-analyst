The Peugeot 504 was introduced in 1968. It broke from Peugeot’s traditionally conservative design language, embracing a more modern and dynamic aesthetic.

### A Long-Lasting Legacy in Africa
In countries like Nigeria, Côte d'Ivoire, and Kenya, the 504 remained sold until the XXI century. The car's durability was largely due to its robust build quality, exceptional ground clearance, and rear-wheel-drive layout, making it well-suited for the challenging road conditions commonly found across the continent.

The 504 eventually faced stiff competition from Japanese automakers. Brands like Toyota and Nissan began to gain a foothold in the African market in the late 1980s and 1990s, offering vehicles that were not only reliable but also more affordable and easier to maintain.

### The American Market: A Brief but Notable Success
Interestingly, the 504 also found some success in the United States, one of the few French cars to do so in the post-war era. In the U.S., it was marketed as a premium European import. Its success in the U.S. was among the last of its kind for a French car, as the American market became increasingly dominated by German and Japanese imports.

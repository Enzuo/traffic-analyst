The project ended up reaching 500 commits. 500 more or less seizable changes in the code of the project.

The project started in 2021 with the idea of analysing how driver behavior impact the flow of traffic. See if one smooth driver is enough to fluidify the pace of traffic or on the contrary, slow it down.

From there the project kinda absorbed another project of mine, the car wiki, which I had started in 2017. The car wiki was about creating a crowd sourced (wiki like) database of car technical details. I have scaled down the ambition in this project by merging it into this one, to first have a static list of cars, that could be used in any project. Years passing it's been a blast to add all those kind of vehicules that have picked my interest over the years and see how they compared to each others.

This project has been quite prone to scope creep, but it's all right as it is an experimentation project, with no commercial ambitions. The initial purpose is yet to be finished as it's missing all the analytics part and my question remain as yet unanswered. Among this initial goal there are thousands of features I would like to implements. Among them :
- How cars compare in various scenario, with a scenario editor.
- Car energy consumption in all simulations, with engine BSCF maps.
- User modifications of car with raw yaml edit in the app, save & load.
- Multi lanes simulation as well as simulations of intersections.
- ... and many more

Reunited for an improbable duel, the Tesla Cybertruck vs the Citroën C15D.
Both vehicles boast cargo space large enough to transport a small hay bale or your various farming tools and can get you from point A to point B in your law abiding journey.

Released to the public in 2023, the Cybertruck promised extraordinary capabilities. However, its initial tests left much to be desired, especially in terms of off-road performance, where it struggled with even basic obstacles. This shortfall led to humorous comparisons on the web with the Citroën C15D, a vehicle nearly 40 years older and ten times cheaper. Originally meant as a joke, these comparisons highlighted how a decades-old, budget-friendly vehicle could, in many ways, rival the futuristic Cybertruck in practical off-road capability.

The C15D, despite its age, remains a model of durability and practicality while being exceptionally affordable. It’s no wonder you can still spot these workhorses navigating the rural roads of France.

This comparison begs the question: Do you really need to spend a fortune to have fun and get the job done?

Despite its flaws, the Cybertruck deserves credit for pushing the boundaries of automotive design and attempting to reinvigorate a field that has remained largely static for years. Innovation comes with risks and challenges, especially when trying to match or surpass the tried-and-true behemoths that have dominated the market for so long.

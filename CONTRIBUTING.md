#### Blender

Origin point of the car body on the wheel level and centered
Empty for each wheel named Wheel#R or Wheel#L
Shade smooth
Auto Smooth around 20Â°
Modeling steps :
- Start by making a box of the size of the car
- Align the blueprints to the box (Front of the car is -Y)
- Model with symetry modifier applied on X axis `body`
- Define texture seam `cmd+E`
- Apply material + base color texture with closest setting (pixelatted look)
- Create a texture of size `256x256` for a basic car size
- Unwrap the texture `U` and use the plugin `Texel Density Checker by mrven` to scale the uv map (Texture size `256` TD `0.33` set my td)
- Model the wheel with a cylinder with a
- Place the wheels empty on each side name them depending on the side `wheel1R` `wheel2L` (could do it with empty rotation but harder to see)
- Move origins so the car `Body` origin is at wheel center level and reset position to 0
- Using gltf exporter -> Export the `Body` + `MiscObj` + `Wheel1R` empties (selection only) (mesh -> apply mirror modifier)
- Export the wheel base model


#### Pixel scale

1m50 -> 50 pixels
1m -> 33.3 pixels
1cm -> 0.33 pixels

#### Texture

If using blueprint as base -> measure their length in pixel & car pixel length `lmm * 0.033` to resize it

Use the crow color palette

First 5 pixels define the colors palette than can be altered to change the car color
1 : base
2 : darker
3 : lighter
4 : darker+
5 : lighter+

#### 2D Scene

1cm -> 0.1 pixel
